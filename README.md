# Tracker.TS

This is a port of [Tracker.js from Meteor](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/blob/devel/packages/tracker/tracker.js) to Typescript.

# Goals

This is a learning exercise or me, as I am familiarizing myself with Meteor.JS.

# Notable Changes

 * References to Meteor have been removed. This project is intended to run as a standalone package.
 * Minor stylistic cleanups, removal of doc comments that are redundant/obvious in typescript

# TODO:

 * Write tests for it to learn how it works.
